        Hello everyone, I hope you're enjooying the conference.
        In this session we're going to talk about Test-Driven Development and how to do it effectively.
        I'm Jakub Sobolewski, I'm a Senior R/Shiny developer at Appsilon. I've been using TDD for almost 3 years.
        I used it in a variety of projects, from small prototypes developed in 2 weeks, to huge apps developed over many months.
        I used it to develop R packages as well.

1. What is TDD?
2. How to do TDD?
3. Why use TDD?

:::

:::{.notes}
In this session we're going to answer three questions:

- What is Test-Driven Development?
- How to do it in R and how we can use it to develop Shiny apps.
- And last, but not least, why should we use it?

I hope that by the end of the session, you'll have a better understanding of TDD and why it's worth giving it a try.

- It is a guided evolution with clear feedback after each step.
- And last, but not least, it's a process where we write tests before we write the production code.

There are 3 steps in TDD.

Red - this is where we start by writing a failing test. It will fail because the code we want to test doesn't exist yet. It will fail as long as we don't solve the problem we stated in the test.

This approach is the other way around to the test-last approach where we write tests to make them pass. It changes the dynamic between prodcution code and tests. In TDD we don't try to prove that the code we wrote works as expected using test. We write code to accomplish what is stated in tests.

::::

:::{.notes}
1. Green - once we have at least one failing test, we can write production code to satisfy it.

Since we have tests, we can run them as often as we need. We have a reproducible way to check if the code we write works as expected. We don't need to setup the environment by hand each time we sit down to write the code or to do a lot of clicking in the app, if we're developing an app.

If the code does what we want it to, tests will pass.

1. We write only as much production code as needed to make tests pass. Why would we write more code, if tests are already satisfied? Don't do it, You Ain't Gonna Need It.

::::

:::{.notes}
1. Last step is refactoring - Were you ever afraid of refactoring your code because you thought you might break something? TDD helps you mitigate this problem. We have tests that ensure that the code works as expected. So we can be more liberal in changes we make to the code. If written well, tests don't constrain us, they empower us to make bold changes.

2. We don't only want to have working code, we want to have good code. We can spend some time in this step to make sure our code is clean and easy to understand.

:::{.notes}
We write down a title of the first behavior we want to implement. This can be the simplest case, just to get us started.

The next step we're about to do was the most scary part of TDD for me. But it was scary only at  the beginning, when I started learning it.

How can we write a test, if there is no code to test?

    numbers <- c(1, 2)

    # Act
    result <- my_sum(numbers)

    # Assert
    expect_equal(result, 3)
  })
})
```

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
1. It's useful to remember that each test consists of three parts:

- Setup
- Execution
- Assertion

We can use #Arrange, #Act, #Assert comments to split our tests into those distinct parts.

1. We start with the setup.

#Arrange is where we prepare the environment. This is where we need to figure out the inputs required to solve the problem.

This is very powerful, why? At this stage, we focus on what we need to be able to solve the problem. Not how we will solve it.

Without understanding the problem we won't be able write down the test. And this is good, we won't write any production code until we have the understanding of the problem. This helps us mitigate the risk of implementing the wrong solution.

1. #Act is where we call our code.

TDD gives us the freedom to experiment with interfaces.

We can try out a few different variants even before we start writing the production code, possibly saving a lot of time on refactoring.

The test you write is the first user of your code. The way you call your code from tests is the way you will call it from the production code. So, think about how you want to use your code and then write it down in a test.

1. In #Assert we focus on how to observe that the code works as expected.

Again, we won't be able to do it without understanding the problem. We should know what is the expected output for given inputs.

But what if it's impossible to know the outcome beforehand? We can still run the test, whithout the assertion, then save the output, check if it's in line with our expectations and save it as the correct result. This is a way to start with TDD when we're not sure what the outcome should be. It's called snapshot testing.

In TDD we first define inputs and outputs, treating the not-yet-existing code as a black box.

This approach produces tests that don't test implementation details. It's impossible to do so since there is no implementation yet!

This makes tests focused on the behavior.

2. We add another case, we expect it to work with a single number. This implementation doesn't do the job. We need to change it.

1. We focus on high-level objectives first.
2. We describe the behavior from the user perspective. If it's a Shiny app, this is the perspective of the user interacting with the app. If it's a package, this is a perspective of the user using the functions exported from the package.
3. We fill in the gaps in code, until tests pass.

So how do we choose the approach?

If we're developing a Shiny module a list of user behaviors we want to implement can be more useful.

If we're developing a computation of a complex algorithm, you might want to start from the smallest piece of the algorithm and build up from there.

A common way of writing down requirements are acceptance criteria. They are a list of verifiable statements. They should be:

:::

::::

:::{.notes}

For high-level tests, as test of Shiny modules it's better to make them abstract, so that they will be true even if the implementation details change.

For tests of a Shiny module, don't tie requirements to the UI. Focus on the business goal. Write those requirements such as if you've never heard about buttons, dropdowns or inputs.

This is the key to having test cases decoupled from implementation.

The example requirement would no longer be valid if we changed the label of the button, or if we removed the button altogether.

But the business goal would still be valid. It should show the summary, no matter how it can be achieved.
:::

So, this means that tests can show that we solved a problem. The will document it, and this documentation will be valid as long as the tests pass. Compared to code comments or other documentations that can get outdated anytime.

📊 Via executable examples on real data.

::::

:::{.notes}

And this also means that we can use tests to communicate with our clients better. We can cooperate more easily, when there is an executable example of their problem. Tests can empower your client to cooperate with you more closely, by them providing you examples to test.

<h2>TDD x Shiny</h2>

- 📦 The testable unit of an app is a Shiny module.

- ✨ It represents a feature.

- 🖥️ It can be run as a standalone app.

::::

:::{.notes}

So let's see how we can use TDD with Shiny.

There are 3 things we need to know before we start.

1. The testable uning of a Shiny app is a Shiny module.
2. A module can represent a feature, and by feature I mean a part or the whole problem we're solving with the app.
3. And that we can easily run modules as standalone Shiny apps.

:::

::::

:::{.notes}
1. We start from setting up the environment. We create a Shiny app from the nonexistent module.
2. Then we create an object that represents the module, it will be a proxy for communicating with the module. We will create it in next steps. For now our only focus is to imagine how we want to use it. We provide human-readable methods that will hide implementation details of the test. This will make tests easier to understand and maintain. Instead of using an object we could use functions. This doesn't matter, do what feels more natural to you. The important part is that we're abstracting the actions we can take on the module.
3. We don't do anything in the execution part in this test. We test the default behavior, when no actions were taken, so it's about the initial state of the module.
4. We assert that the summary is visible.

This is where shinytest2 comes in handy. We can use it to interact with the app from within DatasetSummary methods. It ensures that no implementation details are leaked into the tests. Everything is contained within this object.

Now we may realize, that we need data to show the summary. We can provide it through a data provider object. This could be an existing object in the app, or if we're starting a new app, this can be a fake object that represents a way of getting the data. This way we can test the module in isolation, without the access to the real data. What matters is the interface.

So this data provider just serves the iris dataset via it's get_summary method. The module doesn't know how the data is provided, it just needs to know how to get it. It could be from disk, from a database, it doesn't matter here.

Next we can focus on the assertion.

Think for a moment what outcome means that you met your objective.

In this case, asserting that the table is visible and that it has at least one row is a good way to ensure that the summary is shown.

Notice how this assertion is in a method. This way we can reuse it in other test cases. If at any point in time, our undestanding changes, we can change the implementation of this method, and all tests will be updated.

Pay attention to the name of the method. It's abstract, it doesn't mention the UI, that it's a table. If we decide to show the summary as a plot, this would still be valid. It's the same business goal, no matter how it's implemented.

Once we have the assertion in place, we can implement the module to satisfy the tests.

Notice how here we're testing just the module with a fake data provider. The actual data provider object should be tested in isolation.

By adding a call to a Shiny app, using the same setup as in a test, we can run it interactively. This way we can quickly iterate over the design and make the interface more usable and beautiful faster, without having to run the whole app.

We can also use this for manual exploratory testing or for interactive debugging. This test file is our entry point to the module.

So we've developed one feature. We can expand it with new specification. We can also add new features. Those are high-level tests of Shiny modules, that check if the business goal is achieved. This is supplemented be regular, low-level unit testing that validate business logic.

We end up with tests for all building blocks of the app. We develop and test the parts separately. The sum of the parts is the whole app. This approach helps us maintain development speed, even as the app grows.

So why should you give it a try?

1. To have faster development cycles, with clear feedback.
2. To understand the problem better. It will prevent you from solving something that you didn't understand first.
3. To have confidence that what you're developing is what you need. Also, to have confidence that if you change something, the rest doesn't fall apart.
